## Ruby with rails - WIP
***Why is it soooo dificult to setup? Spent hours on small little issues that could have easily be resolved with a little more docs / script***

WIP: need to learn some more basics of how ruby and rails work behind the scenes
Need to understand better how sessions are being handled and controllers in global

## Node (NestJS) - WIP
- Swagger - Installed
- Need to add schemas (Currently set only on login)
- - DB handled with typeorm and pg - Posts and users creation and fetching works with relations
- - Still need to add more logic for update and delete
- Auth - Works
- - Not sure if to init user entity and pass it as a class into the request or leave as is? Will benefit for dataSource and db craete docs but that's it
- - All end points are behind auth 
- - Special IsPublic decorator was created as only a small sum are open API calls for example login / register
