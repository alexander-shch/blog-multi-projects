              Failed to implement User.postCount, tried:

              - `Types::UserType#post_count`, which did not exist
              - `User#post_count`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:post_count` or `"post_count"` on `#<User:0x0000000110c67f80>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              - Looking up hash key `:posts` or `"posts"` on `#<User:0x0000000110c783a8>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.
